## Conclusion

Unit tests helped me find errors at the development stage of the second version of the application and leave the same interface for the list as before. Tests are very useful in commercial projects because every broken part of the application equals lost money. They are needed to make a reliable program that is not easy to break and whose code can be changed if necessary so that the program continues to work.
